    <h1>Project</h1>
    <p>This project is a translation of Alex Ayala's Lunar Lander project from Fundamentals of Computing. 
    The original project was written in C++ and this project is written in Python 3 using <a href="https://pygame-zero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Pygame Zero</a>.
    This inspiration for this project came from a desire to translate Alex's old code into an updated Python version. 
    Our end goal for this project was to have a working game with improvements from the old version. Some updates that we included
    were the addition of sound and updated fonts.
