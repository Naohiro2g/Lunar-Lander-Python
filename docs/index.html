    <h1>Project</h1>
    <p>This project is a translation of Alex Ayala's Lunar Lander project from Fundamentals of Computing. 
    The original project was written in C++ and this project is written in Python 3 using <a href="https://pygame-zero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Pygame Zero</a>.
    This inspiration for this project came from a desire to translate Alex's old code into an updated Python version. 
    Our end goal for this project was to have a working game with improvements from the old version. Some updates that we included
    were the addition of sound and updated fonts.
    </p>
    <h1>How to use</h1>
    <h2>Installation<h2>
    <p>To install the project, clone the <a href="https://github.com/aayala4/Lunar-Lander-Python/">GitHub repository</a>. Make sure that
    you have the latest version of Python 3 and Pygame Zero installed. Next, you need to download the font pack to get the game to work.
    The instructions to do that are found <a href="https://github.com/aayala4/Lunar-Lander-Python/blob/master/fonts/readme">in this readme</a>.
    Finally, run the program with the command <code>python3 lunarLander.py</code>. lunarLander.py is our main file.

    <h2>Screenshots</h2>
    <p>Below are screenshots from the game.</p>

    <p>Here is what the screen will look like during normal gameplay.</p>
    <h3>Fuel</h3>
    <p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aayala4/Lunar-Lander-Python/master/images/outoffuel.png" alt="Out of Fuel" /></p>
    <p>The rocket gets a certain amount of fuel per round. When the fuel expires, the game is done. The image above shows the screen
    when you run out of fuel</p>
    <h3>Crash<h3>
    <p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aayala4/Lunar-Lander-Python/master/images/crash.png" alt="Crash" /></p>
    <p>If you land too fast or don't land with the ship in a vertical angle, you will crash the ship. The photo above shows this.</p>
